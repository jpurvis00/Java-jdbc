# Java-jdbc
After finishing the MOOC Java course, I now need to figure out how java and databases interact.  I'll be posting my code here with the eventual goal of writing a java program to help at work.  

Currently our website inventory is not connected to our ERP software(Epicor).  We are exporting a inventory via BAQ.  The web admin is pulling that report, massaging the data in excel and then uploading into the website inventory db.  The plan is to write a program that will pull that data from the Epicor db, massage the data into the correct format and ftp that file to the web server.   I will then have a second java program running on the web server that will be watching for that ftp file and take the contents and upload it to the inventory table.  The web admin is only running this process once a week which creates a problem with having accurate current inventory for the end user.  I can set this up to run nightly(or really as often as I want) via job scheduler or cron and keep the website inventory more accurate.
